# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a modern React-based task management frontend application. The application will provide a clean, minimalistic interface for managing workspaces, projects, and tasks through a hierarchical structure. It will integrate with an existing REST API backend and offer an intuitive user experience with a black and white design aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage workspaces, so that I can organize my projects and tasks in logical groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a list of available workspaces
2. WHEN I click on a workspace THEN the system SHALL navigate to the workspace detail view showing its projects
3. WHEN I create a new workspace THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/workspaces` with title, description, ownerId, and memberIds
4. WHEN I edit a workspace THEN the system SHALL send a PUT request to `/workspaces/{id}` with updated information
5. WHEN I delete a workspace THEN the system SHALL send a DELETE request to `/workspaces/{id}` and remove it from the UI
6. WHEN I add members to a workspace THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/workspaces/{id}/members`
7. WHEN I remove members from a workspace THEN the system SHALL send a DELETE request to `/workspaces/{id}/members/{userId}`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage projects within workspaces, so that I can organize related tasks together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a workspace THEN the system SHALL display all projects belonging to that workspace

4. WHEN I delete a project THEN the system SHALL send a DELETE request to `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/projects/{projectId}`
5. WHEN I archive a project THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/projects/{projectId}/archive`
6. WHEN I click on a project THEN the system SHALL navigate to the project detail view showing its tasks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage tasks within projects, so that I can track work items and their progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a project THEN the system SHALL display all tasks belonging to that project
2. WHEN I create a new task THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/projects/{projectId}/tasks` with title, description, priority, deadlineDate, tags, and categories
3. WHEN I edit a task THEN the system SHALL send a PUT request to the task endpoint with updated information
4. WHEN I delete a task THEN the system SHALL send a DELETE request to the task endpoint
5. WHEN I complete a task THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/tasks/{taskId}/complete`
6. WHEN I assign a task THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/tasks/{taskId}/assign` with the user ID
7. WHEN I unassign a task THEN the system SHALL send a DELETE request to `/tasks/{taskId}/assign`

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add comments to tasks, so that I can collaborate and provide updates on task progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a task detail THEN the system SHALL display all comments for that task
2. WHEN I add a comment THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/tasks/{taskId}/comments` with authorId and content
3. WHEN I edit a comment THEN the system SHALL send a PUT request to `/tasks/{taskId}/comments/{commentId}` with updated content
4. WHEN I delete a comment THEN the system SHALL send a DELETE request to `/tasks/{taskId}/comments/{commentId}`

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to attach files to tasks, so that I can provide additional context and resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a task detail THEN the system SHALL display all file attachments for that task
2. WHEN I add a file attachment THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/tasks/{taskId}/attachments` with fileName, fileType, and fileSize
3. WHEN I delete a file attachment THEN the system SHALL send a DELETE request to `/tasks/{taskId}/attachments/{attachmentId}`

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set up recurring tasks, so that I can automate repetitive work items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a recurring task THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/tasks/{taskId}/recurring` with type, interval, and endDate
2. WHEN I view a task with recurring settings THEN the system SHALL display the recurrence information
3. IF a task has recurring settings THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the task display

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and modern interface, so that I can work efficiently without visual distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN I navigate between sections THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy and navigation
3. WHEN I interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate hover states and feedback
4. WHEN I view content THEN the system SHALL use consistent typography and spacing
5. WHEN I use the application on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL be responsive and usable

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and reliable performance, so that I can work without delays or interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display the initial view within 2 seconds
2. WHEN I navigate between views THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly without blocking the UI
3. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
4. WHEN I perform actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
5. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive navigation, so that I can easily move between workspaces, projects, and tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in any view THEN the system SHALL display breadcrumb navigation showing my current location
2. WHEN I want to go back THEN the system SHALL provide clear back navigation options
3. WHEN I am viewing a list THEN the system SHALL provide search and filter capabilities
